How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs by actively listening, observing, and engaging with users to understand their requirements. Creating user stories helps by breaking down these needs into manageable, understandable units, guiding the development process with a focus on user-centric outcomes.
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When approaching program development, I will consider starting with clear requirements being gathered, followed by iterative development cycles. Incorporating agile processes like Scrum or Kanban can enhance development efficiency and flexibility. These methodologies will emphasize incremental progress, frequent communication with stakeholders, and adapting to any changes as they come along.
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means collaborating effectively, solving problems together, adapting to changes, being accountable, continuously learning, sharing knowledge with one another, and focusing on quality.
